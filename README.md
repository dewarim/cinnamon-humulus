#Grails plugin: cinnamon-humulus

This plugin contains the classes for switching between databases and checking login attempts against the current repository.

Note: this repository contains code for an new release (Cinnamon 3) which will be heavily refactored since we are
trying to convert from a split application (Java Server with custom Servlet code, accessed by desktop and Grails
applications for the webclient and the administration interface) to a more unified server using the Grails framework.

The Cinnamon CMS version 2 is stable and in production use, the project home is: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cinnamon
The development version 3 here is still in its early stages and subject to change.
